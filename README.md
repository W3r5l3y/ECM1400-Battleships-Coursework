# ECM1400 Assessment - Battleships

## Description

This project is an implementation of the classic game Battleships. The game is played on a grid where each player places a number of ships. Players then take turns guessing the coordinates of the other player's ships. The goal of the game is to sink all of the other player's ships.

## How to run

To run the game, simply run the `main.py` file. This will start the game and allow you to play.

## How to play

The game is played on a grid. Each player has a number of ships which they place on the grid. Players then take turns guessing the coordinates of the other player's ships. If a player guesses a coordinate where a ship is placed, the ship is hit. If a player guesses all of the coordinates of a ship, the ship is sunk. The game ends when one player has sunk all of the other player's ships.

## How to test

To run the tests, run the `test.py` file. This will run all of the tests and display the results.

## How to use

The game is played using the command line. When the game starts, you will be prompted to enter the number of players. You will then be prompted to enter the number of ships each player will have. You will then be prompted to enter the size of the grid. You will then be prompted to enter the coordinates of each ship. You will then be prompted to enter the coordinates of each guess. The game will then be played and the results will be displayed.
